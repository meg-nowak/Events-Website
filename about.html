        <p>Social youth: a company designed by two young students with the aspiration to create a website promoting events around New Zealand. The two students/ creators of the company saw a gap in the market for the promotion of social events for students… so instead of sitting back and relaxing they chose to create a website, the website would promote all social events for youth and students to encourage all too interact with each other, one month later here it is. Here at social youth we are all about celebrating young people, we want to show everyone events specifically made for youth, to encourage everyone to get out of the house and have some fun! it is time for you to shine: no more being bored with friends, or stuck at home in the weekends. It’s time to explore Auckland’s concrete playground full of hidden opportunities. check out our website we have every single personality to cater for. Whether you like theatre shows, festivals, foodie events, exhibitions or even conferences. We can show you them! social youth was created with the purpose of evolving our adult orientated society full of events that youth can’t attend. Come join us, we promise to find you something to go to!</p>
